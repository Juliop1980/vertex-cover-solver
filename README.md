# Algorithm-Engineering

## Course Workflow:  
Participants will program and present a solver for the problem Vertex Cover (defined in the first lecture slides).
In regular intervals (approx. 3 weeks) the participants have to submit their program for testing (and for a small informal competition for the fastest program). Additionally, for each submission the participants will submit a short PDF ([here](https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=1396815) is a template the pdf should consist of at most one page of text, but any number of figures---all of which are referenced in the text) and present their program in a short (max. 10 minutes) talk followed by a question round (in presence!). For each submission, there will be slides + screencasts explaining more and more algorithmic ideas and an exercise sheet specifying the implementation and presentation tasks.
